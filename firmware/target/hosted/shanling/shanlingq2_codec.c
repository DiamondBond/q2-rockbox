/* The Q2's CS43131 DAC, ALSA card 0, is driven through /dev/shanling_dac as
 * stock demo and hciplayer do (tools/shanlingq2/README). The DAC sits at its
 * 0 dB step and Rockbox's volume is all in pcm-alsa's 32-bit mixer.
 * ponytail: the DAC's own steps (0.5 dB from about -38 dB up, coarser below,
 * per the driver's tables) could take the coarse part, if the noise floor at
 * low volume ever matters.
 *
 * Bluetooth: Q2 Pod starts Rockbox from its Home menu with the headset it
 * connected still connected (its daemons outlive the stock player), so a
 * headset that bluez-alsa's "bluealsa" PCM opens on is the output, and the DAC
 * stays off. "bluealsa" is the most recently connected device through plug,
 * which converts Rockbox's rate and 32-bit samples to the link's. pcm-alsa
 * feeds it from a thread (it has no async callback), and falls back here,
 * to the DAC, when the headset goes away. Headphones in either jack win over
 * Bluetooth: bluez-alsa can still hold a PCM for a headset that isn't in
 * anyone's ears (earbuds linked from their case), and that played to nobody.
 *
 * Idle: as stock's check_dacoff_state, the DAC powers off DAC_IDLE_TICKS after
 * pcm-alsa stops and on again before it starts, the PCM left open throughout.
 * The driver keeps the rate from hw_params, without I2C while off, and applies
 * it at power on, so a rate change before the wake is fine. */
